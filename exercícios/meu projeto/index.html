        <p>As NFL fans, we always love to discuss the best offensive skill players in the   NFL. It's a hobby type of thing where we can debate with our friends/co-workers about who the best players are at their positions.<br>
        The wide receiver position has become especially deep over the past few seasons, with elite classes coming out of the NFL Draft.</p>

            <h2>Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals</h2>

            <p>Chase is fast becoming one of the mega-stars of the NFL, and despite a hip injury costing him a portion of the season last year, he had some great weeks down the stretch.</p>
            <p>His close friendship with quarterback and LSU teammate Joe Burrow canâ€™t be ignored. The two should be the face of the Bengals for years to come.</p>
            <p>I have Chase as my top prediction to win the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award.</p>

            <h2>Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
            <picture>

            <p>There's really no other option than to rank Jefferson first at this point, as he's just ascended to the top by brute force. We've watched Jefferson evolve from a prospect who was rumored to only be able to play the slot, to a megastar that plays any receiver position needed at an extremely high level.</p>
            <p>From the highlight-reel catches to the double teams he's able to defeat, Jefferson should be the best receiver in football for potentially years to come. The Vikings are ranked No. 9 on our NFL offense power rankings.</p>
